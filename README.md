# NCCR_FEA_Workshop


Installation checklist
======================

Because of the size of the Abaqus installation files and the different licensing systems for each research group, it will not be feasible to leave the Abaqus installation and set-up till the day of the workshop. Both Abaqus and its licensing, as well as Rhinoceros and also its licensing, should be sorted before the workshop day, including the set-up of any VPN if moving network. Please contact liew@arch.ethz.ch in due time for any assistance on any installation issues. **Note**: the workshop is based on a Windows environment, Abaqus as the FE solver, and Rhino as the CAD software. The general preparatory installation steps needed to participate in the workshop are:


CPython
-------

- Install a CPython distribution such as Anaconda or the official Python download.
- Make sure the **NumPy** and **SciPy** packages are installed, for example via ``pip``.
- For optional features (not officially part of the workshop) install **MeshPy**, **Vtk**, **PyQt5**, **PyOpenGL**.


compas
------

- Clone the main ``master`` branch **compas** repository, using a repository manager like GitHub desktop or SmartGit.
- Add the ``src`` folder to your ``PYTHONPATH`` in ``Advanced System Settings`` > ``Environment Variables``.
- Add the ``src`` folder to your Rhino Pythonscript folders.


compas_fea
----------

- Clone the main ``master`` branch **compas_fea** repository, using a repository manager like GitHub desktop or SmartGit.
- Add the ``src`` folder to your ``PYTHONPATH`` in ``Advanced System Settings`` > ``Environment Variables``.
- Add the ``src`` folder to your Rhino Pythonscript folders.


Abaqus

- Install the academic (ETH/EPFL network licensed) Abaqus version 6.14, other versions *seem* to work fine.
